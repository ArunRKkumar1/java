      Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed
      by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995.
      It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning code written
      in Java can run on any operating system that has a compatible 
      Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" 
      capability is one of Java's key features, achieved through bytecode,
      an intermediate representation of compiled Java code that
      can be executed on different platforms.
